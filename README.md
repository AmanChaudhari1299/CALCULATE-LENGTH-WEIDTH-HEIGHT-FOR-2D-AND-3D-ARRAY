# CALCULATE-LENGTH-WEIDTH-HEIGHT-FOR-2D-AND-3D-ARRAY<BR>
EXPLANATION:-<BR>
IN THE PROGRAM WE FIRST CALCULATE LENGTH AND WEIDTH OF RECTANGLE FOR 2 DIMENSION ARRAY<BR>
AND THE NEXT WE CALCULATE LENGTH , WEIDTH & HEIGHT OF RECTANGULAR BOX FOR 3 DIMENSION ARRAY<BR>

LOGIC:-<BR>
LOGIC IS SIMPLE 1ST FOR 2D TAKING INPUT USE SCAN STATEMENT AND JUST MULTIPLY BOTH VALUE USING ASTRIKS SYMBOL<BR>
NEXT FOR 3D TAKE 3 VALUE AS LENGTH , HEIGHT & WEIDTH FIRST MULTIPLY FIRST TWO AND NEXT SOLN AND THIRD VARIABLE<BR>
